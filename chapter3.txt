When he finally performed the songs, circumstances were harsh as always. Upon arriving at the venue after riding seven miles on his 
ancient steel bike, he could hardly remember his own name let alone the extensive lyrics to the relatively complicated second song. He
managed to get through get through the first easily, even drawing a laugh. The second song, with its challenging and potentially 
cringe lyrical content, required 2 false starts before he was able to get through. Put it down to abuse on the trip down from RP.
